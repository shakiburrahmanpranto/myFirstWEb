  Clutching a toothbrush and toothpaste, Kevin Lik waited for six hours in the
  main office of penal colony 14, near Arkhangelsk in Russia’s far north-west.
  It was late in the evening of Sunday 28 July, and the 19-year-old says he had
  no idea what was about to happen. "Maybe you’re taking me to be shot," he said
  to the governor of the colony. "Don't worry, everything will be fine," came
  the reply. Kevin says he was told the same thing by an officer from Russia's
  FSB state security agency a year and a half ago, before they locked him up
